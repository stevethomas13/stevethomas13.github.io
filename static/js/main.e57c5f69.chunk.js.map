The game, titled \"Immersive Adventures,\" takes full advantage of the Hololens 2's capabilities to create a truly engaging experience.</p>\n                <p>In \"Immersive Adventures,\" players are transported to a virtual world seamlessly integrated with their real environment. The Hololens 2's spatial mapping and gesture recognition features are harnessed to allow players to interact with virtual objects and characters in a natural and intuitive way. The game leverages the device's advanced sensors to provide a high level of immersion, making it an unforgettable AR gaming experience.</p>\n                <p>The project involved a combination of Unity3D for game development and the Hololens 2 SDK to optimize the game for the specific features of the device. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into AR development and the challenges and opportunities presented by the unique characteristics of the Hololens 2.</p>\n                \n                <p><b>Vue.js Calculator: \"CalcVue\"</b></p>\n                <p>Another project in my portfolio is \"CalcVue,\" a modern calculator built using Vue.js. The goal was to create a sleek and user-friendly calculator application that takes advantage of Vue.js's reactive and component-based architecture.</p>\n                <p>\"CalcVue\" offers a responsive and dynamic user interface, with real-time updates as users input calculations. The Vue.js framework allows for efficient state management, making the calculator highly responsive and providing a seamless user experience. The project also incorporates custom styling for a visually appealing design.</p>\n                <p>Vue.js's two-way data binding and component reusability were instrumental in creating a well-structured and maintainable codebase. The calculator supports standard arithmetic operations as well as more advanced functions, making it a versatile tool for various mathematical tasks.</p>\n\n                <p><b>Bicep Curl Form Detector: \"FormFit Tracker\"</b></p>\n                <p>For fitness enthusiasts, I developed a \"FormFit Tracker,\" a bicep curl form detector using MediaPipe and OpenCV. This project aims to assist users in maintaining proper form during bicep curl exercises, reducing the risk of injuries and ensuring an effective workout.</p>\n                <p>The system utilizes the power of MediaPipe for pose detection and OpenCV for image processing. By analyzing the user's body movements and posture in real-time, the FormFit Tracker provides immediate feedback on the quality of bicep curl form. Visual cues and real-time corrections are displayed to guide users in maintaining the correct posture and movement throughout the exercise.</p>\n                <p>The integration of machine learning and computer vision technologies in fitness applications showcases the potential for technology to enhance physical training and promote safer workout practices. The FormFit Tracker is not only a demonstration of technical skills but also a practical tool for improving fitness routines.</p>\n\n            </Col>\n        </Row>\n\n        \n\n    </Container>\n\n    );\n}","import React  from 'react';\nimport About  from './About'\nimport Projects from './Projects';\n\nexport default function Home() {\n\n    return (\n        <div>\n            <Projects />\n            <About />\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n","// import './App.css';\nimport React  from 'react';\nimport { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Navbar from './components/myNavbar';\nimport Home from './pages/Home';\nimport About from './pages/About';\nimport Projects from './pages/Projects';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <BrowserRouter>\n    <Routes>\n      <Route path=\"/\" element={<Navbar />}>\n        <Route index element={<Home />} />\n        <Route path=\"about\" element={<About />} />\n        <Route path=\"projects\" element={<Projects />} />\n      </Route>\n    </Routes>\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';\n// import './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));\nroot.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
